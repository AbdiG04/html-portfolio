<h3>Superman - J. Gunn</h3>

<p>Yea, I know. Recency bias. Regardless, it's a great movie. It doesn't need to establish another superman origin. We've gotten how many anyways. We know who superman is and what he stands for, so to see an actual plot surround him instead of the regular dialogue of whether the people of earth accept him or not is great for the future of the DCU.</p>
<h3>Thor: Ragnarok</h3>

<p>This is definitely one of my favorite marvel movies of all time. I was introduced to the MCU from the first Thor movie. So to see him progress without mjolnir was an exciting first.</p>
<h3>The Longest Yard</h3>

<p>The remake comedic version with Adam sandler and it's diverse set of characters never fail to bore me.</p>
